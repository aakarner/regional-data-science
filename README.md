# Regional Data Science for Mobility Justice
Transportation equity means different things to different people. Over the past 10 years, academic and applied research on the topic has exploded. New terms like transport justice and mobility justice have emerged with different diagnoses of the problem and recommendations for solutions. At their core, these different perspectives all desire similar outcomes--fair transportation systems that connect people to the opportunities they need to lead a meaningful life. But their emphases on process versus outcomes, historical injustice versus future-oriented planning, and the scale of analysis all differ substantially. 

In this course, we will engage with these emerging questions and debates while honing our skills in data science and quantitative reasoning. I've been working in the areas of transportation equity and justice analysis for over 10 years and I have the overwhelming sense that our methods have stagnated, not because of a lack of sophisticated data or methods but because academics and practitioners generally don't use advances in theory to inform their methods and analyses. In our course, we will begin to rectify this problem. 

The course will operate as an applied research seminar, blending in-class discussion, written reflections, GIS lab work, fieldwork, and guest speakers. I do not plan to offer traditional lectures very much, although I will elaborate on key concepts during our discussion time. 

# Learning objectives
Upon completing this course, students will have acquired new skills (and solidified existing ones) through in-class discussion and debate, applied data science exercises, reading responses, and a synthetic final project.

Specifically, the course has several broad categories of learning objectives. These include those related to defining, applying, and critically engaging with key equity and justice theories and concepts as well as others that are focused more on geographic information systems (GIS) and GIScience data and methods. 

Transportation equity, transportation justice, and mobility justice
We will engage with the emerging literature on mobility justice and place it within the context of earlier work on transportation equity and justice. Specifically, we will:

- Articulate and compare key contemporary ideas about transportation justice and equity
- Problematize standard engineering approaches to transportation planning and transportation equity
- Describe how public transit (and transportation in general) is political
- Motivate public engagement work in notions of dignity and repair
- Compare and contrast different methods for achieving equity and justice

## GIS/GIScience
In addition to covering the transportation and mobility justice literature, we will learn contemporary analytical methods for evaluating integrated transportation and land use systems using the statistical computing language R. Specifically, we will: 1) apply GIScience methods and data to address accessibility and equity challenges, 2) use specific pieces of software, tools, and data and 3) apply general programming and GIS best practices. Some of these objectives you may already be familiar with while others might be completely new. Even if we do not cover a specific problem type during the class, once it is over, you should be familiar with the types of problems that GIScience methods can solve and the data available to solve them. You will be able to interrogate the implications of specific analytical choices (e.g., areal units, data sources, metrics) to determine the best approach for a given situation.

Specific learning objectives within each of the three categories are as follows:

## Accessibility and equity
Accessibility—defined simply as ease with which people can reach valued opportunities—is the fundamental benefit conferred by a transportation system. Accessibility undergirds travel behavior and land use. Students will calculate, compare, and critically evaluate different measures of multimodal accessibility in a GIS-T environment.
Social equity, fairness, and justice are transportation planning goals embedded in federal law and guidance but whose analysis is often poor or nonexistent. Additionally, evidence is mounting that more equitable cities and regions are also more economically competitive and environmentally sustainable. Students will use results drawn from their GIS-T investigations to operationalize and assess equity conditions in cities and regions across the United States.

## Specific software, tools, and data
Students will gain proficiency in contemporary software, tools, and data to assess accessibility and equity in transportation systems including:

## R to calculate service areas, travel times, and routes and conduct equity analysis.
OpenStreetMap as a source of free, readily accessible data with which to build routable networks.
General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data to represent transit networks and travel times by public transit within a GIS-T framework.
The US Census Bureau and tidycensus as valuable sources of demographic, employment, and transportation information.
Other software, tools, and data according to student interest.
General programming and GIS best practices
Students will also gain invaluable experience with data management and programming including:

- Troubleshooting and resolving challenging problems that arise when using a particular piece of software or developing your own scripts.
- Writing elegant and well-commented scripts and code.
- Acquiring, organizing, and managing large amounts of data and complex analyses.

# Course expectations and policies

## Teaching modality
This class will meet in person.

## Attendance
Attendance during all class periods is required. I will consider your attendance record when assigning participation grades. Please let me know by email if you're going to miss a class and provide a reason. Students alone are responsible for any material missed during absences. 

## Readings
There is no assigned textbook for this course. All readings are available either on Canvas or are linked to from the syllabus. I have chosen the readings carefully. Their number varies by week, depending on whether we are focusing on discussion or will be getting into more data work. Carefully reading the assigned material before class is vitally important. (See further information in the assessments section below.)

## Use of laptops, phones, and other devices
I expect you to be present and engaged during class time. Please turn all cell phones to silent (not vibrate) during class time. To avoid distraction and for the benefit of your fellow students, please refrain from using any electronic devices for non-class material during class time. Research has demonstrated that your knowledge retention will be maximized if you take notes by hand.

## Disability accommodations
Any student requesting accommodations because of a disability will be referred to Services for Students with Disabilities. The staff will work with you to arrange for appropriate accommodations. The student will receive an accommodation letter that will be reviewed with me. 

## Plagiarism and cheating

We will be completing writing assignments for this course. Plagiarism involves using the words or ideas of another person as your own. It is perfectly acceptable to borrow ideas from other scholars. Indeed, this is how scholarship advances. But those words and ideas must be appropriately referenced with a citation and page number, as appropriate. Please use APA format for work prepared for this class. If you are planning to continue in academia, it will be in your interest to learn to use one of the many pieces of citation management software. Zotero is a great option that’s free for everyone (Links to an external site.).

Note: All work completed for this class will be checked against the institutional Turnitin repository which includes other student submissions.  Turnitin is a software resource intended to address plagiarism and improper citation. The software works by cross-referencing submitted materials with an archived database of journals, essay, newspaper articles, books, and other published work. In addition, other methods may be used to determine the originality of the paper. This software is not intended to replace or substitute for my judgement regarding plagiarism detection.

If you are caught plagiarizing or cheating, you will be evaluated according to the University of Texas Honor Code. For any questions involving these or any other Academic Honor Code issues, please consult me or http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/student-discipline-and-conduct/Links to an external site.. If you are not sure what constitutes cheating or plagiarizing, please come see me to discuss. 

DO NOT USE CHATGPT OR ANY OTHER LARGE-LANGUAGE MODEL TO PREPARE CONTENT FOR THIS CLASS.

# Assessments
The student assessments for this course will involve a mix of in-class participation, formal presentations, written reading responses, and a final project presentation and report. Some of these will be completed in groups, but unless explicitly identified as group work, all work is to be completed by you alone. Details regarding each assessment category are provided below.


# Participation
I encourage active and constructive participation from students during class time. Since you are all graduate students with interests in transportation planning, GIS, and justice, I expect that you will have strong opinions about which data and methods should be used to best address transportation planning challenges and how we should understand contemporary transportation justice challenges. Our readings will also provide fodder for discussion. Please share your opinions during class while being respectful of other students’ opinions and time. We will sometimes have structured in-class participation activities involving small group discussions combined with reporting back to the larger class. Students are expected to be active and engaged during these times. These activities are designed to provide students who are less comfortable speaking in a large group the opportunity to be heard and to solidify key learning objectives through deeper student engagement. Your attendance will also factor into your participation grade. 

# Discussion lead
To facilitate our discussion of the various course readings, all students will lead at least one discussion during the semester. Leading the discussion does not mean that you have to undertake an exhaustive analysis of a text or texts, but rather prepare a short (10-12 minute) summary of the principal arguments, followed by some questions that you would like the class to discuss. Each week, we will have one or more volunteers who will help in this effort.  Slides are not required but can be used if you wish.

# Perusall reading responses
You will complete short reading assignments prior to class using PerusallLinks to an external site.. Perusall is a "social e-reader." Each week, I'll load your readings and sometimes other media into a Perusall assignment. You'll login and create annotations in each document.  These annotations can address things that you agree or disagree with, questions you have about the material, responses to the annotations created by your classmates, or . 

The Perusall assignment is in lieu of a more typical reading responses, so I expect that each week you'll create at least 2-3 annotations per piece. The first paragraph should include a short summary of the readings from that week and the rest of the response should reflect on the readings to highlight critical questions, tie the work to other materials we've engaged with throughout the course or that you've found on your own, or relate them to your own experiences. 

Here's a short video on Perusall basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1mW_TXtd-c&ab_channel=MaggieGoverLinks to an external site.

# Labs
Because there is no formal lab time scheduled for the course, portions of some class periods will be run as traditional lab sessions where students will have an opportunity to work on an applied problem using R and related software. Labs will provide hands-on experience with the software, data, and methods that are the core of the course. There will be no graded lab submissions; you will complete them for your own edification and to help with completing the assignments. The lab materials will be cumulative, so if you must miss one due to absence, I strongly suggest that you quickly make it up.

# Final project
Details forthcoming. 

# Policy on late work
All written work must be turned into Canvas at the date and time noted on the assignment prompt. Work submitted late will receive reduced credit of five points (on a traditional 100-point grading scale) per day or portion of day late, unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.
