**Course Description**: This course examines the related concepts of transportation equity and mobility justice using seminar-based discussion and data science techniques. Students will learn to identify and address pressing transportation challenges by immersing themselves in the contemporary literature and analyzing data and applying programming best practices. Key substantive topics include defining mobility justice, transportation activism and advocacy, and travel needs and barriers. On the data science side, we'll cover data wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python libraries including pandas, geopandas, and Altair. Through hands-on exercises, case studies, and discussions, the course emphasizes practical skills while fostering debate on the role of transportation systems in shaping broader access to opportunities. I recognize that not many planning students have prior programming experience. Accordingly, there are no prerequisites for the class. To succeed, you should have a willingness to engage with computational tools, desire to experiment, and strong ability to persist in the face of challenge.
