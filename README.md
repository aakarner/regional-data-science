**Course Description**: This course examines the related concepts of transportation equity and mobility justice through the lens of data science. Students will learn to address pressing transportation challenges by analyzing data and applying programming best practices. Key topics include data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis using Python libraries including pandas, geopandas, and Altair. Through hands-on exercises, case studies, and discussions, the course emphasizes practical skills while fostering debate on the role of transportation systems in shaping broader access to opportunities. Prior programming experience is not required, but a willingness to engage with computational tools is essential.
